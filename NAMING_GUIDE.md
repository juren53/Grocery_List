# Quick Reference Grocery Naming Guide

This guide helps you format grocery items for optimal categorization by the Grocery List Organizer.

## General Naming Principles

### ✅ DO: Use Common, Generic Names
- **Be descriptive but simple** - Include key identifiers that match category keywords
- **Use natural language** - Write items as you would say them
- **Include important modifiers** - Brands, types, or varieties that help with matching

### ❌ DON'T: Overthink It
- **Don't worry about exact formatting** - The system is flexible
- **Don't use abbreviations** - Write out full words when possible
- **Don't omit key descriptors** - "tea" alone is vague; "green tea" or "tea bags" is better

## Key Examples: Why Specificity Matters

### 🌽 The "Corn" Example
**Corn shows up in 4 different store sections!** Being specific is crucial:

| Item Name | Goes To Section | Why? |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| **corn on the cob** | Produce / Fresh Fruits & Vegetables | Fresh corn in produce |
| **popcorn** | Snacks / Chips / Crackers | Packaged snack item |
| **canned corn** | Canned Goods / Soups | Shelf-stable canned goods |
| **frozen corn** | Frozen Foods | Frozen vegetables |

If you just write "corn", the system might not know where you're planning to buy it!

### 🫖 The "Tea" Example
**Tea also varies by type and format:**

| Item Name | Goes To Section | Why? |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| **tea bags** | Coffee / Tea | Packaged tea for hot brewing |
| **iced tea** | Beverages / Water | Bottled/ready-to-drink beverage |
| **green tea** | Coffee / Tea | Specific tea variety |
| **tea leaves** | Coffee / Tea | Loose leaf tea |

Simply writing "tea" doesn't tell the system enough about what you're buying.

## Special Tips

### 🏷️ Brand Names
Including brand names is helpful, especially when they're part of how you shop:

- ✅ "Dole salad"
- ✅ "Lay's chips"
- ✅ "Ritz crackers"
- ✅ "Tropicana orange juice"

### 📦 Quantities and Sizes
Feel free to include quantities—they won't interfere with categorization:

- ✅ "2 gallons whole milk"
- ✅ "24 pack bottled water"
- ✅ "1 lb ground beef"
- ✅ "dozen large eggs"

### 🎯 Ambiguous Items
Some items could fit multiple categories. Be specific:

| Ambiguous | Better Alternatives | Why Specific? |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------| 
| "corn" | "corn on the cob", "popcorn", "canned corn", "frozen corn" | Each goes to a different section! |
| "tea" | "tea bags", "iced tea", "green tea", "tea leaves" | Format and type matter |
| "snacks" | "potato chips", "pretzels", "granola bars" | Different snack types |
| "drinks" | "soda", "juice", "water" | Beverage type matters |
| "fruit" | "bananas", "apples", "oranges" | Specific fruits |
| "vegetables" | "broccoli", "carrots", "lettuce" | Specific vegetables |
| "meat" | "chicken breast", "ground beef", "pork chops" | Cut and type |

### 📝 Descriptive Notes
You can add notes without breaking categorization:

- ✅ "Free Price Chopper water - 24 pk - see email"
- ✅ "cinnamon honey apple sauce for Eva"
- ✅ "Friday Freebie - Tropicana Orange Juice - see email"

The system looks for keywords within your full text, so notes are fine!

## Quick Categorization Test

Not sure if your item name is good? Ask yourself:

1. **Would someone else know what I'm looking for?**
2. **Does it include the main product type?** (bread, milk, tea, etc.)
3. **Does it include important variety info?** (green tea, whole wheat bread, etc.)
4. **Could this item be in multiple store sections?** (like corn or tea?)

If yes to all, you're good to go! ✅

## What If It's Still Uncategorized?

If an item doesn't get sorted automatically:

1. The program will ask you to categorize it interactively
2. You can add it as a new keyword so it sorts correctly next time
3. The system learns from your choices and gets better over time

**Pro tip:** The more specific you are with item names when adding keywords, the better future categorization will be!
